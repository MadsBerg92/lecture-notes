- The origin of Javascript: a language to implement little animations on web pages.

- What is the DOM? 

- Why manipulate the DOM?
	- interactive web applications
	- animations
	- chrome extensions


- Read [the Introduction to DOM article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) and then make sure that you can answer the following: 
	- What is the DOM? 
	- Can you give examples of DOM elements?
	- How do you manipulate the DOM from Javascript? 

- Read the [Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events) article, and make sure that you can answer the following: 
	- [What is an event](## [What is an event?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#what_is_an_event)) 
	- What is an event handler function?
	- How do you use [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#using_addeventlistener)? 
	- What are [other event listener mechanisms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#other_event_listener_mechanisms) besides addEventListener?
	- What are [event objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_objects) good for? 
	- Why would you want to [prevent default handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#preventing_default_behavior) of events? Give examples of situations when this is the case. 

- Where to read details about the DOM API? There's a [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) for that.

## Live Demo + Exercise

Implement an interactive TODO list application using plain Javascript and DOM manipulation. Including: 
- dynamically adding new items
- deleting individual items
- marking items as "done"
- drag-and-drop reordering of itemss (challenge for home; look at this [example](https://code-boxx.com/drag-drop-sortable-list-javascript/))

Given that this is a live demo, we'll definitely have the chance to show some of the following: 
- debugging 
- refactoring
