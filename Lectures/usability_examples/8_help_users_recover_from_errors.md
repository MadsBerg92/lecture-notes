## Most Uninformative Tautology 

Mircea: In the summer of 2023, I booked a scooter in Arad, my hometown in Romania using the Bolt app. After I agreed to make a payment of 1RON (approx. 0.25EUR) to prove that my card is valid, and after I saw the notification from the bank that the payment was done, the app showed probably the most useless error message in the history of error messages.
